                <p class="mb-6 text-gray-700">Career trajectory demonstrates a consistent progression and increasing responsibility across diverse financial domains, culminating in specialized roles within the Luxembourg fund industry. Journey reflects a strong learning agility and a proven capacity to adapt to new markets, functional areas, and increasingly complex, strategic responsibilities. This adaptability is particularly evident in the transition from client-facing roles in India to project management and then to compliance and oversight positions in Luxembourg. This broad exposure across retail/private banking, mutual funds distribution, wealth tech project management, and highly specific fund oversight and regulatory compliance is uncommon. It suggests a comprehensive understanding of the financial ecosystem from multiple angles—product development, distribution, client management, and regulatory control—and experience at various points of the value chain. This versatility implies an ability to understand the interdependencies between different functions within a financial institution, enabling contributions to holistic solutions and strategic initiatives.</p>

Duties extended to reviewing various legal documents, such as ManCo reports, SLAs, PPMs, and other fund documents, ensuring alignment with regulations like MiFID, BMR, and prospectus regulation. A key area of focus was ESG-SFDR checks on funds, classifying them as Article 6/8/9 (light green or dark green) based on fund literature and aligning policies/procedural documents and reporting. Direct involvement in classifying funds and reviewing frameworks highlights hands-on expertise in a highly specialized and sought-after domain, positioning as well-versed in the practical application of ESG regulations. Participated in PRIIPS-KIID production, overseeing external producers and advising on pre-production wording for investor suitability.

These packages included NAV packs, investor statements, capital account statements, and financial statements prepared by the designated Center of Excellence (COE). A core responsibility involved verifying the accuracy of complex calculations such as income allocations, expense accruals/allocations, management/performance fees, carried interest, waterfalls, foreign exchange, and security valuations. This required reconciling critical data points across various entities, including fund administrators, custodians, prime brokers, and investment managers. Was also tasked with documenting control testing results, identifying any control gaps or weaknesses, and escalating findings with actionable recommendations for remediation, which were then tracked and validated. Furthermore, monitored key risk indicators (KRIs) and reported on the overall risk profile of assigned funds and relationships.</p>

Successfully identified and prevented material NAV errors prior to release through rigorous review processes, thereby safeguarding substantial Assets Under Administration (AUA) data and averting potential client financial loss and reputational damage. This demonstrates a keen eye for detail and a strong commitment to financial accuracy. Also addressed a critical operational hurdle by consolidating fragmented, unstructured data from multiple sources. This involved designing and implementing an automated matching solution alongside rigorous manual data cleansing, which resolved inconsistencies and uncovered key data gaps. This project significantly elevated data quality controls and delivered a robust, hybrid (automated/manual) reporting tool that directly improved the reliability and timeliness of mandatory CSSF year-end filings and SAQ submissions. This operational transformation through data automation highlights the ability to turn complex data challenges into streamlined, compliant processes.</p>
